# Searching Algorithms

### Linear Search 
* Sequential searching algorithm 
* O(n) time complexity
* Find index of a value in array with loops like for,foreach.

### Binary Search 
* Interval searching algorithm 
* O(Log n) time complexity which means faster than Linear Search.
* Using for sorted data types.
* Find index of a value in sorted array with comparing mid value and searching value .

### Jump Search
* Similar approach with Binary Search.
* O(Log n) time complexity.
* Using for sorted data types.
* Find index of a value in sorted array with jumpin in blocks as square of length.

# Sorting Algorithms

### Selection Sort
* O(Log n) time complexity.
* Find minimun value and put it in beginning
